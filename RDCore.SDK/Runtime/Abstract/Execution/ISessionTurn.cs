/// A session runs one thing at a time. The interpreter is not re-entrant from two threads, and the objects of a program are not safe to be read by one thread while another
/// changes them - but the objects of a library are not the program's to schedule. A host application raises an event when something happens to it, at a time that is its own,
/// on a thread that is its own; the procedures that handle the event are the program's, and run in the program's session.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>MS-VBAL</strong> says when an event is handled only for the events of the language itself (<strong>§5.4.2.20</strong>: <c>RaiseEvent</c> invokes the handlers, there and
/// then), and for the others it says only that <c>DoEvents</c> "yields execution so that the operating system can process externally generated events"
/// (<strong>§6.1.2.8.1.5</strong>). The rest is how MS-VBA gets an event from a host application, which is a call from the server to the program, and a program can only take a
/// call when it is not busy: while it waits for a call of its own to return (the server raises <c>NewWorkbook</c> before <c>Workbooks.Add</c> returns, and the handlers may
/// answer it), when it yields with <c>DoEvents</c>, and when it is over. That is all of it: nothing is handled in the middle of a statement, and a program that does none of these
/// is a program no event reaches. Until the session is open to it (<see cref="IsOpenForEvents"/>) an event waits, and so does whatever raised it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A program that is running holds the turn, and gives it up while it waits for a call to finish (<see cref="Yield"/>), which is what opens the session to the events.
