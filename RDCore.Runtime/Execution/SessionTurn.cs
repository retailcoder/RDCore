/// The turn is a baton. A program takes it when it starts and gives it up while it waits for a call, and an event takes it for as long as its handlers run; nobody runs without
/// it. What is not the baton is the rule for who may take it: a synchronous event may whenever it is free - which it is, because the program that made the call it was
/// raised by gave it up - and an asynchronous one only when the session is <see cref="IsOpenForEvents">open to them</see>, which is when no program runs or one pumps. Deciding
/// which an event is belongs to whatever received it, which knows whether a call was pending.
