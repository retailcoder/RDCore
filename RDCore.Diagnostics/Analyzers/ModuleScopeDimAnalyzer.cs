/// <c>RDC00202</c>: a <c>Dim</c> statement at the module level, which declares <c>Private</c> variables (<strong>MS-VBAL §5.2.3</strong>).
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// A module-level variable that states no access modifier can only have been declared with <c>Dim</c>. One finding is made for each statement, however many variables it declares.
/// The fix writes <c>Private</c> in place of the <c>Dim</c> the statement starts with: its variables are as accessible as they were.
/// <para>
/// A statement of several names is this finding's and not <c>RDC00204</c>'s, since its one keyword declares every variable of the list
/// (<strong>MS-VBAL §5.2.3.1</strong>). The fix then also declares each name on a line of its own, as <c>RDC00204</c>'s fix does:
/// <c>Dim a, b As Long</c> is <c>Private a</c> and <c>Private b As Long</c>, and nothing is left for <c>RDC00204</c> to find. It is not offered for a
/// statement of several names that declares a <c>WithEvents</c> variable, which <c>RDC00204</c>'s fix does not split either: written <c>Private</c>
/// and not split, the statement would be <c>RDC00204</c>'s.
